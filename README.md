# GH_EnergyPlus
collection of hardcoded energyplus problems in GH


[Source code](../master/GHEnergyPlus/GHEnergyPlus/GHEPlusRunParametric15_Zurich.cs) for the building energy demand component of the publication [Waibel, Evins, Carmeliet (2019). Co-simulation and optimization of building geometry and multi-energy systems: Interdependencies in energy supply, energy demand and solar potentials. Applied Energy].(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.177)

Some scripts for conducting sampling (monte-carlo, sensitivity analysis, etc.) named as GHEplusRunSobol... All other scripts are basically obsolete, most of them are used in this [BEO benchmark problem set](https://github.com/christophwaibel/BEOBenchmark).
